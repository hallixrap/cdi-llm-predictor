🔴 HIGH-VALUE DOCUMENTATION OPPORTUNITIES (Major CC/MCC):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Acute blood loss anemia (D62)
   Category: Anemia
   Clinical Evidence: Hemoglobin dropped from 9.8 g/dL (2 months ago) to 6.5 g/dL on admission in the setting of acute GI bleeding (hematemesis). Patient required transfusion of 2 units PRBCs.
   Query Reasoning: Acute blood loss anemia is not explicitly documented as a diagnosis, though there is clear evidence of acute hemoglobin drop due to GI bleeding and transfusion requirement. This is a high-value secondary diagnosis for DRG assignment.
   Confidence: High

2. Hepatic encephalopathy (K72.91)
   Category: Encephalopathy
   Clinical Evidence: Patient was frequently disoriented and agitated during hospitalization. Physical exam showed asterixis (flapping tremor). Ammonia level was elevated at 125 µmol/L. Mental status improved with lactulose.
   Query Reasoning: Altered mental status, asterixis, elevated ammonia, and response to lactulose are classic for hepatic encephalopathy. The diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the summary and should be clarified for coding and severity capture.
   Confidence: High
