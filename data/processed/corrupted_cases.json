Overall Impression  Glasberg is a 24 Y male  with history of cystic fibrosis (genotype:G542X/17171-1G to A), severe obstructive lung disease, chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure, ABPA (on Xolair until ~2022), h/o MSSA, MRSA and Pseudomonas, significant CF liver disease/cirrhosis, EPI (on Creon), CR-related osteoporosis, CFRDM (on insulin pump with CGM), malnutrition (on supplemental G-tube feeds), Port-A-Cath placement.     Recently hospitalized at CPMC for Pseudomonal pneumonia and MRSA. He had also been receiving near weekly paracenteses for his refractory ascites while hospitalized at CPMC.     Hospital course  Admitted 02/13/2024 for lung-liver transplant evaluation, presenting with hemoptysis and worsening ascites. He underwent paracentesis and was treated empirically for HAP with Vancomycin and Jelinek. His hospital course c/b acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to decompensated liver cirrhosis with worsening ascites, fever secondary to administration of immunizations  that eventually resolved with no identifiable source, unwitnessed fall found to have possible chronic fracture of L greater tuberosity with no invasive management needed.

He was concerned that he could not go home in that condition and was also feeling very weak like he can't get up and move. His daughter is a nurse here. They decided to leave OCH today and present to Stanford.     He was told by his doctor a long time ago that he had fatty liver but states that at that time he did not know the cause. He found out about his cirrhosis about five years ago at which time he stopped drinking. He was previously a \"heavy drinker.\" He has at one point in the past had a GI bleed, sounds like it was about two years ago although difficult to ascertain based on oral \nhistory. Last two years he has undergone paracentesis a few times. He had endoscopy about two years ago at which time they put some rubber bands and has gotten EGD three times total. He was in the hospital     ADLs: can't feed self because of L hand cellulitis and R arm bicep tear, dependent for all ADLs, is continent     IADLs: currently son is handling finances, daughter medicines, dependent for all other tasks as well, can use a phone. Very limited by balance problems, hand pain.     He is full code. His daughters and son are his surrogate decisionmakers.     Interview with Dtrs:     Daughters Anton whom he lives with and Sixto Osborne who works as a nurse clarify the timeline. He was told he had fatty liver several years ago and has been completely abstinent from etoh x5 years. 1.5 years ago he was first diagnosed with cirrhosis when he was admitted for upper GIB with hematemesis and melena and underwent esophageal variceal banding. He also got his first paracentesis at that time and since then had two more scheduled paracenteses in the outpatient setting. A few months ago he had cholecystitis which was managed conservatively. He also had another skin infection about two months ago. He recently fell at home and tore multiple ligaments in his R shoulder as well as his bicep tendon and has been debilitated 2/2 that. Because of his debility he moved in with Benedetto. He has since fallen again on his L side since which his L hand has swollen up. At the recent hospitalization he was treated empirically for UTI but continued to have worsening hand swelling on ancef and they became concerned that he wasn't getting adequate care there and decided to bring him here. He has a planned outpatient appt to establish with hepatology and discuss transplant evaluation, which has not yet happened.     Chart Review/Recent hospitalization:   At OCH for decompensated cellulitis and infection. S/p para 10/8 and 10/10. Getting diuresed \nwith spiro, lasix, and metolazone. INR noted 8.6 and did received vit K 10mg x1. Suspected UTI and initially started on cipro but BCx grew GPCs and he was transitioned to cefazolin 2g q8h and had worsening L hand swelling and pain. Hand MR showing fluid cx no cf osteo w hand surgeon consulted recommending perc drain due to coagulopathy. Had AKI to 2.2 which is improving, baseline is 1.1.   \"    Hospital Course and Discharge Plan, by Issue:     Brief Summary:  Niebuhr is a 74M hx T2DM, cirrhosis presumed 2/2 alcohol c/b variceal bleeding s/p banding, req multiple recent large volume paras, presenting following fall w L hand cellulitis, fth MSSA bacteremia, OM/dsicitis of T2-3, and septic L wrist/hand, now on cefazolin and s/p L hand debridement x2 w ortho. Admission c/b AKI likely 2/2 ATN with fluctuating renal function, as well as recurrent ascites s/p large volume paracentesis. Patient was discharged with cefazolin to SNF with close follow-up from ID, Hand Surgery, and hepatology, and referrals to orthopedics and urology placed as well.    Hospital Course by Problem:    # Complicated MSSA Bacteremia  # Recurrent MSSA bacteremia  # LUE Cellulitis  # Disruption of FDP, high-grade partial vs. Complete tear of FHL  # T2-T3 Discitis-Osteomyelitis  Initially with MSSA bacteremia at OSH in 12/14/2023 after fall on L side, tx'd with 7 days of antibiotics (Cefazolin, followed by Grace Dobson), no repeat cultures for clearance. Re-presented 02/04/2024 with one week R hand pain and swelling and increasing redness following a repeat fall, again grew MSSA on BCx and treated with Cipro -> Ancef with continued worsening of hand swelling with L hand MRI ultimately showing multiple loculated fluid collections. Transferred to Stanford for Hand evaluation and per family request. CT LUE here without fluid collection, no osseous changes. Continue on IV Cefazolin with significant improvement. 1/11 BCx x2 from OSH first NGTD. ID \nconsulted for MSSA bacteremia - recommend continuing IV abx given complicated MSSA bacteremia (initial fluid collection in hand), further imaging to r/o abscesses, osteomyelitis as below, found with T2/T3 osteomyelitis/discitis and now MRI L hand and forearm 02/22/2024 with multiple fluid collections.

Initial concern for HRS, now s/p albumin challenge 1 g/kg q24h x 2 with improvement in UOP near admission. Nephrology consulted ~01/15 with higher concern for prerenal etiology given urine studies - diuretics held and significant volume resuscitation with FFP, albumin with subsequent improvement in AKI. Signed off 02/16/2024. Woodruff placed 1/15 due to concerns from obstruction, trialed removal 1/20 with failure, trialed again \n1/24 with Flomax and passed. Creatinine stable back to 1.83 on 01/31 at present, up from prior baseline of 1.0 (question new baseline vs. continued poor perfusion due to intravascular depletion from liver disease). Nephrology re-consulted 01/31 and bladder scan 01/31 showing 1000cc, s/p straight cath w/o much output, now s/p Waheed re-placement 01/31 with urology. Nurse noted urine to be purulent / thick / cloudy, however urology believes likely smegma. Renal believes recent AKI either likely obstructive vs. ATN from reecnt surgery requiring 3x pressors intraoperatively.

Patient reportedly has fluid collection dorsal to fourth and fifth metacarpal. COMPARISON: MRI report from 02/10/2024 (no images available). PROCEDURE COMMENTS: : Multiple axial postcontrast CT images were obtained of the left hand, wrist, and distal forearm.  Images were reconstructed with bony and soft tissue algorithms and reformatted in the coronal and sagittal planes. Dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 28.5. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 571. FINDINGS: Soft tissue: Examination limited by large field-of-view imaging. The reported fluid collection on the outside MRI exam is not seen on today's CT, which could at least partially due to limitation of our CT exam. No soft tissue gas. Soft tissue swelling along the dorsal wrist. Bones and joints: No destructive osseous changes involving the wrist. Additional findings: Cirrhosis with intra-abdominal ascites. Tiny metallic density in the stomach.     IMPRESSION: 1.  Examination limited by large field-of-view imaging. The \nreported fluid collection on the outside MRI exam is not seen on today's CT, which could at least partially due to limitation of our CT exam. 2.  No destructive osseous changes. 3.

(02/07 1655) (Park, Pellegrini, MD)     Reason for Hospitalization: Concern for osteomyelitis  Principle Diagnosis at Discharge: L4-L5 osteomyelitis  Secondary Diagnoses: Urinary tract infection    Summary of Hospital Course:     Nereida Lucey was admitted on 02/29/2024 for dysuria and lower abdominal pain, and found to have L4-L5 osteomyelitis and discitis with phlegmon. He was evaluated by spine surgery in the ED, who did not recommend any surgical intervention. There were no neurologic changes. He received ertapenem and vancomycin in the ED. He did not have evidence of sepsis. Urine culture grew E coli, sensitive to cephalosporins (full sensitivities below). After arriving on the floor, immunocompromised ID was consulted, who recommended holding antibiotics and pursuing bone biopsy. This was completed on 2/9. Gram stain and culture of these specimens was negative, and 16s sequencing was pending at the time of discharge. ID felt that the urinary tract infection was the most likely etiology of the osteomyelitis, but recommended broad coverage with ertapenem given no conclusive organism identified and history of ESBL infections.     Plastic surgery was consulted for stage 4 decubitus \nulcers which did not demonstrate evidence of infection, and recommended no intervention, as flap repair would be expected to heal poorly given immunosuppression for renal transplant.     The patient had a history of anaphylaxis to ceftriaxone, and allergy was consulted to comment the safety of administering other cephalosporins to the patient. They recommended avoiding 3rd and 4th gen cephalosporins due to similarity of their side chains. The patient was challenged with cephalexin on the day of discharge and monitored, and did not demonstrate any evidence of allergy to this medication.     Follow-up  [ ] PCP - coordination of care, monitoring of treatment response and tolerability of ertapenem, monitoring of leukocytosis (present on discharge without new infectious source)  [ ] ID - monitoring of osteomyelitis treatment response, following up 16s sequencing, determination of antibiotic duration and possible narrowing, monitoring abx tolerability  [ ] Allergy - further evaluation of cephalosporin allergy  [ ] Urology - evaluation for recurrent UTIs  [ ] Transplant Nephrology - monitoring of immunosuppression and function of allograft    Medication changes:  - Starting IV ertapenem 2/9 with anticipation of 6 week course of IV antibiotics, although may be narrowed in ID clinic pending 16s sequencing of bone biopsy  - Zofran prn for nausea secondary to antibiotic use    Note: patient tolerated a graded challenge to cephalexin on 03/08/2024.     Hospital Course and Discharge Plan, by Issue:     # UTI, complicated (Vikki Ellen)  # L4/L5 discitis/osteomyelitis  # Paravertebral plegmon  # Stage IV decubitus ulcers  Long history of recurrent UTIs with most recent UCx from 02/08/2024 growing pan-susceptible E faecalis; other past cultures have grown ampC, ESBL orgs. Ucx during current admission grew Odalis Tanaka susceptible to cefazolin, nitrofurantoin. Noted on CT to have possible L4/L5 osteomyelitis and confirmed on MR. In setting of + \nMRSA swab and chronic stage IV decubitus ulcers, initially started on ertapenem + vanc, then held pending bone bx per ID recs. Bone bx completed 2/9, studies NGTD, discharged on ertapenem with ID follow-up and possible narrowing spending 16s studies  Increasing leukocytosis on 2/12 (while on ertapenem) without localizing infectious symptoms. Dc'ing foley as possible nidus of infection, would continue to monitor after discharge, and if he develops diarrhea rule out c diff. .   Dx:  - ESR >140   - CRP 7.2  - CTAP 02/29/2024  1.

(02/07 1655) (Park, Pellegrini, MD)     Reason for Hospitalization: Concern for osteomyelitis  Principle Diagnosis at Discharge: L4-L5 osteomyelitis  Secondary Diagnoses: Urinary tract infection    Summary of Hospital Course:     Nereida Lucey was admitted on 02/29/2024 for dysuria and lower abdominal pain, and found to have L4-L5 osteomyelitis and discitis with phlegmon. He was evaluated by spine surgery in the ED, who did not recommend any surgical intervention. There were no neurologic changes. He received ertapenem and vancomycin in the ED. He did not have evidence of sepsis. Urine culture grew E coli, sensitive to cephalosporins (full sensitivities below). After arriving on the floor, immunocompromised ID was consulted, who recommended holding antibiotics and pursuing bone biopsy. This was completed on 2/9. Gram stain and culture of these specimens was negative, and 16s sequencing was pending at the time of discharge. ID felt that the urinary tract infection was the most likely etiology of the osteomyelitis, but recommended broad coverage with ertapenem given no conclusive organism identified and history of ESBL infections.     Plastic surgery was consulted for stage 4 decubitus \nulcers which did not demonstrate evidence of infection, and recommended no intervention, as flap repair would be expected to heal poorly given immunosuppression for renal transplant.     The patient had a history of anaphylaxis to ceftriaxone, and allergy was consulted to comment the safety of administering other cephalosporins to the patient. They recommended avoiding 3rd and 4th gen cephalosporins due to similarity of their side chains. The patient was challenged with cephalexin on the day of discharge and monitored, and did not demonstrate any evidence of allergy to this medication.     Follow-up  [ ] PCP - coordination of care, monitoring of treatment response and tolerability of ertapenem, monitoring of leukocytosis (present on discharge without new infectious source)  [ ] ID - monitoring of osteomyelitis treatment response, following up 16s sequencing, determination of antibiotic duration and possible narrowing, monitoring abx tolerability  [ ] Allergy - further evaluation of cephalosporin allergy  [ ] Urology - evaluation for recurrent UTIs  [ ] Transplant Nephrology - monitoring of immunosuppression and function of allograft    Medication changes:  - Starting IV ertapenem 2/9 with anticipation of 6 week course of IV antibiotics, although may be narrowed in ID clinic pending 16s sequencing of bone biopsy  - Zofran prn for nausea secondary to antibiotic use    Note: patient tolerated a graded challenge to cephalexin on 03/08/2024.

(02/07 1655) (Park, Pellegrini, MD)     Reason for Hospitalization: Concern for osteomyelitis  Principle Diagnosis at Discharge: L4-L5 osteomyelitis  Secondary Diagnoses: Urinary tract infection    Summary of Hospital Course:     Nereida Lucey was admitted on 02/29/2024 for dysuria and lower abdominal pain, and found to have L4-L5 osteomyelitis and discitis with phlegmon. He was evaluated by spine surgery in the ED, who did not recommend any surgical intervention. There were no neurologic changes. He received ertapenem and vancomycin in the ED. He did not have evidence of sepsis. Urine culture grew E coli, sensitive to cephalosporins (full sensitivities below). After arriving on the floor, immunocompromised ID was consulted, who recommended holding antibiotics and pursuing bone biopsy. This was completed on 2/9. Gram stain and culture of these specimens was negative, and 16s sequencing was pending at the time of discharge. ID felt that the urinary tract infection was the most likely etiology of the osteomyelitis, but recommended broad coverage with ertapenem given no conclusive organism identified and history of ESBL infections.     Plastic surgery was consulted for stage 4 decubitus \nulcers which did not demonstrate evidence of infection, and recommended no intervention, as flap repair would be expected to heal poorly given immunosuppression for renal transplant.     The patient had a history of anaphylaxis to ceftriaxone, and allergy was consulted to comment the safety of administering other cephalosporins to the patient. They recommended avoiding 3rd and 4th gen cephalosporins due to similarity of their side chains. The patient was challenged with cephalexin on the day of discharge and monitored, and did not demonstrate any evidence of allergy to this medication.     Follow-up  [ ] PCP - coordination of care, monitoring of treatment response and tolerability of ertapenem, monitoring of leukocytosis (present on discharge without new infectious source)  [ ] ID - monitoring of osteomyelitis treatment response, following up 16s sequencing, determination of antibiotic duration and possible narrowing, monitoring abx tolerability  [ ] Allergy - further evaluation of cephalosporin allergy  [ ] Urology - evaluation for recurrent UTIs  [ ] Transplant Nephrology - monitoring of immunosuppression and function of allograft    Medication changes:  - Starting IV ertapenem 2/9 with anticipation of 6 week course of IV antibiotics, although may be narrowed in ID clinic pending 16s sequencing of bone biopsy  - Zofran prn for nausea secondary to antibiotic use    Note: patient tolerated a graded challenge to cephalexin on 03/08/2024.     Hospital Course and Discharge Plan, by Issue:     # UTI, complicated (Vikki Ellen)  # L4/L5 discitis/osteomyelitis  # Paravertebral plegmon  # Stage IV decubitus ulcers  Long history of recurrent UTIs with most recent UCx from 02/08/2024 growing pan-susceptible E faecalis; other past cultures have grown ampC, ESBL orgs.

After the fall, he had worsening of his chronic lumbosacral back pain. He had gotten a courses of antibiotics prior to the fall for presumed CAP. He presented to OSH E  had neg CT head and a CXR w possible infiltrate, and again received tx for CAP.      He returned home but \nwas completely disoriented and confused. His daughter found him sitting in chair in the hallways but he couldn't tell her why he was there. He was able to state his name and birthday but was doing repetitive behaviors and saying non-sensical things (about going to a farm for instance). He did not seem to be responding to internal stimuli or hallucinating.     Re-presented to Adventist with AMS and was hospitalized for roughly 1 week (2/10-2/18). Repeat CT head neg and CTA H&N neg for LVO  While there underwent an LP that was reportedly negative for infection or inflammation (but no full encephalitis panel was sent). He received norco for his backpain and got 5 days of high dose IV steroids, two days of prednisone 60 and was discharged on pred 60. His gabapentin was held.

Visualized paranasal sinuses: Mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses. Mastoid air cells: Clear. Bones: Lytic/lucent areas are seen within the biparietal regions (5/49 and 29) which correspond to areas of enhancement seen on the recent outside MRI from 01/31/2024 (11/5 on that study). Additional comment: Intracranial vascular calcifications. Bilateral lens replacements.     IMPRESSION: 1.  No acute intracranial abnormality. 2.  Lytic/lucent areas are seen within the biparietal regions (5/49 and 29) which correspond to areas of enhancement seen on the recent outside MRI from 01/31/2024 (11/5 on that study). Imaging findings are concerning for aggressive osseous lesions with differential considerations including multiple myeloma and osseous metastatic disease. Correlate with any known history of primary malignancy and appropriate workup. 3.  Prominent bilateral low-density extra-axial spaces likely representing a combination of subdural hygromas and prominent subarachnoid spaces without evidence of underlying acute hemorrhage. 4.  6 mm right parafalcine calcified lesion (2/155) likely corresponding to a small calcified meningioma, as seen on the prior MRI.

Surg, Huynh, ICID consulted. On 1/14 noted to have worsening leukocytosis, rectosigmoid colitis, soft tissue fluid collections in LLE on imaging. GI consulted - less likely to be ICI related colitis. ICID advised Pavlides + PO Vanc. HLH workup in the setting of Anemia and Thrombocytopenia.On 1/15 Edema and erythema improving on RUE. Awaiting HLH testing - Soluble IL2, CXCL9. Started on Lasix 40 mg IV BID for swelling. On 1/16 ID requesting drainage + studies of LLE fluid collection, however IR + gen surg unable to intervene at this time. On 1/18 completed 7 day course of zosyn. Hematology consulted iso thrombocytopenia and oral Prednisone \nstarted given not much change in limb swelling. LFTs worsening - cholestatic picture although bilirubin wnl. RUQUS showing pancreatic duct dilation and calcification. Per Heme, does not meet enough criteria for HLH at this time. MRI with MRCP liver with evidence of severe Iron Overload. Heme advised audiology and ophthalmology testing after discharge and follow up in Heme clinic to start chelation therapy.

(pls see detailed note Clinic Visit by Downs, Holt Longe, MD (02/14/2024). Monitored for two days for clinical stability and discharged home on 1/22.      Brief HPI - Per Admission H&P:   As per admission H&P:  \"Per excellent discharge summary from 01/15/2024, patient presented with \"severe sepsis, Pseudomonas bacteremia, neutropenic fever, and ecthyma gangrenosum of port site. She was started on broad antibiotics. She was initially in the MICU, then deemed floor appropriate. General surgery consulted. She underwent several debridements, washouts, and negative wound vac exchanges with general surgery. IP consulted. She underwent a pleural catheter placement for effusion. Palliative consulted to assist with GoC and pain control. Psych consulted to assist with management of adjustment disorder and insomnia. Patient transferred to plastics service for debridement of R axilla and chest. She underwent harvest of omental flap (Dr. Vemula); micro-anastomosis and omental flap reconstruction of R chest wall, axilla and upper arm; and split thickness skin graft from right thigh to omental flap. She was transferred to medical oncology for pain control and diuresis of her anasarca. She was transitioned to orals for pain, but after further discussions with the patient, she elected to have IV pain meds inpatient, with the knowledge that she would go have to orals when she leaves the \nhospital. She also elected to have IV lasix twice a day for her anasarca, and her electrolytes were repleted as needed. She was trialed on a PO regimen for diuretics and will continue on PO lasix 80 mg BID when she is discharged. Derm consulted. Punch biopsy of a LLE wound over a surgical scar showed involvement of her angiosarcoma.  She worked with CM and decided with her family on transferring to the Prescott . She last had nivo/ipi 11/3. PET scan 12/19 showed overall concern for disease progression. Our most recent request in December for another dose of immunotherapy inpatient was denied, so she will be transferred to the LTAC and will go to the infusion centers here for further immunotherapy.\"     Per chart review:  12/29 seen in plastics clinic by Dr Slowey, gave wound dressing recs and recommended she can wear a soft bra and can use ACE wrap to reduce R arm swelling and can dc 90 degree splint and can use Elton Chapel sling instead.  1/5 had phone call with ortho PA noted LLE swelling, warmth, redness, recommended abx for cellulitis of LLE as well as CT to assess for deep fluid collection, was not performed until ED presentation  1/78 received C1D1 Gemzar, tolerated well without incident  1/9 had derm visit with Dr Bien, at which time noted to be on outpatient ceftriaxone IV at kentfield LTAC     Patient reports for past few days, her LLE has gotten more swollen and red, and has slowly spread up her leg up to the lower abdomen. She has also developed progressively more edematous and erythematous RUE. All areas of redness are painful and tender, she describes pain as sharp and sensitive. Also with itchiness for which she has taken some Benadryl for. Overall reports significant pain and requesting pain medication. Also reporting some nausea. Has not had any trauma or inciting events preceding these skin changes, though notes the redness and swelling that she came in for occurred after she got chemo. No \nblistering noted, no oral/vaginal mucosal involvement.     Otherwise denies fevers, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea. Has never had a reaction like this to medications before. No missed medications.\"    Hospital Course and Discharge Plan, by Issue:     #Edema and erythema of LLE and RUE  #History of ecthyma gangrenosum of R chest port site  #s/p debridement and omental free flap thickness skin grafting to R chest axilla  Patient with extensive history of angiosarcoma and ecthyma gangrenosum of port site, s/p multiple surgical interventions, now presenting with progressive swelling and redness of LLE and RUE.

Continued on IV antibiotics per ID. Unable to proceed with original CK plan per neurosurgery due to patient's obesity, therefore remained inpatient for 15 fractions of radiation per radiation oncology.     The discharge plan, including (but not limited to) medications, wound care instructions, warning signs, physical activity limitations, and follow-up information were reviewed with the patient and family, who verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan.    Radiation Oncology:  DIAGNOSIS: Illiana Nagi, \"Illiana\", MRN [000000], 40 Y male Foramen magnum meningioma s/p STR 12/04/2023 c/b signif neuro deficits, grade 1 on path but growing solid/cystic component on 1 mo interval scan, readmitted for wound dehiscence and pending inpt IV abx. S/p VMAT to residual meningioma.     XRT hx:  VMAT to residual meningioma 40.05Gy/15fx (01/28/2014-02/17/2024)     IDENTIFICATION and INDICATIONS: Mr. Nagi underwent definitive (non-metastatic) radiotherapy for post op residual meningioma. Mr. Nagi was initially seen for consultation and after he indicated an understanding of the rationale, risks, and potential benefits of radiation therapy, informed consent was obtained and placed in the medical record.     COURSE:  A CT simulation was performed with Mr. Sweeney in the supine position. A customized immobilization device was created to minimize inter-fraction variability in patient positioning. Target volumes were \ndelineated using computerized software and special care was taken to limit the radiation dose to surrounding critical structures. Mr. Nagi was seen weekly on treatment for side effect management and supportive care. The treatment was tolerated without unexpected side effects.      Predating RT and ongoing/status by end of treatment:  -Per pt some new mvmt in L hand fingers (baseline was just R hand finger mvmt); no worsening neuro issues (wkness/numbness/etc)  -Stable intermittent mild headaches w stable neck spasms (worsens when coughs) being managed by inpt  -Since before current admission, continued episodes of blackout/unresponsiveness that happen after strong coughing     -Coughing has decreased in past few weeks but still present given the trach  -Stable intermittent mild nausea     Medical management and supportive care by inpatient team.

Johnson now sutured in.   - SLP consult for PMV    ENT Recommendations 12/30:  - Patient now has a 6-0 cuffed Shiley in place, sutured to the skin. Obturator should be above bed at all times   - Trach change was performed without difficulty. This is a mature tracheostoma. In the future, would not advise patient to be induced with cuffless tracheostomy. If for some reason patient has cuffless tracheostomy in place but requires positive pressure ventilation, his tracheostomy can be exchanged by any skilled RT or Anesthesia provider to a cuffed tracheostomy tube using an obturator. While awaiting obtaining a cuffed tracheostomy in such a scenario, occlude the mouth and nose to ventilate via the cuffless tracheostomy until a cuffed device can be obtained.   - Please \nalso note patient is intubatable from above - 11/17 anesthesia note indicates difficult two handed mask; however, he was G1V with video laryngoscope GVL STAT 4. From ENT standpoint, could also consider LMA as a rescue device if unable to recannulate stoma in an emergency.    - Patient has trach sutured in place. DO NOT DISCHARGE PATIENT WITH TRACH SUTURED IN. When ready to allow soft blue collar, sutures will need to be cut and trach should be exchanged to cuffless if he is not requiring PPV   - Tracheostomy was initially placed by Pulmonology and we defer further tracheostomy management to their team. If pulmonology colleagues require our assistance in cutting suture or swapping tracheostomy when the time comes per Neurosurgery, please notify us at pager 27085.      #s/p PEG tube placement  - Recommend SLP c/s (patient was making progress per report at SNF)  - Recommend Nutrition c/s for TF  - Continuous TF at present     #Gout  No active flares at this time per patient but commonly gets in L foot     # Delirium prevention  - Baseline cognitive status:  A&Ox4  - Risk factors for delirium: N/A  - Use delirium order set (\"IP Gen Delirium\")  - Use delirium accordion/summary report on EPIC to identify current deliriogenic meds -- Minimize use as able  - Limit opiates/benzos/anticholinergics as able.

Glass, MD, MBA  Surgical Co-management Hospitalist    Infectious Disease Assessment & Plan:  Illiana Nagi is a 39 YO M with a PMHx notable for HTN and relatively recently discovered 2cm foramen magnum mass s/p resection (12/04/2023 with pathology + for meningioma) c/b wound dehiscence now s/p wound revision/I&D. ID consulted for antimicrobial recommendations.     #Foramen magnum mass s/p subtotal resection c/b SAH + wound dehiscence c/f underlying infection   Interval history notable for recent admission for subtotal resection of foramen magnum mass c/b SAH into intraventricular space, loss of Sentinel Butte /LE motor function, and double vision. Patient additionally had PEG tube and trach placed following surgery. Post-operative course now complicated by incision site breakdown concerning for possible underlying wound infection.      Patient went to OR on 12/31 with notation of superficial infection, though on further discussion with NSGY team, they did note that infected area did directly contact skull bones. After discussion with NSGY team, decision made to treat patient for prolonged duration given above findings (contact with bone) + M&M of undertreating infection close to CNS. Reassuringly, no clinical evidence of meningitis on exam.     Intra-operative cultures with growth of MSSA \n+ Klebsiella aerogenes (with a low MIC to cefepime). Klebsiella aerogenes can harbor a chromosomal ampC (inducible beta-lactamase) with preferred agents for treatment including cefepime (poor inducer and substrate for ampC) or carbapenems. With RE: to oral therapy, we note that with patient's weight/size, he would require extremely high doses of bactrim for treatment, so would recommend avoiding and continuing treatment with cefepime on discharge. We also note that separate wound culture from 12/31 demonstrated growth but was too young to identify and is being reincubated. We expect this to grow out previously isolated MSSA or Klebsiella, but please do not hesitate to reach back out if culture grows out new organism not covered by cefepime.     Current renal function:  Estimated Creatinine Clearance: 290.1 mL/min (A) (by C-G formula based on SCr of 0.56 mg/dL (L)).       RECOMMENDATIONS:  - Follow up 12/31 intra-operative cultures to finality  - Recommend continuing IV cefepime 2g Q8H               - Anticipate treatment for at least 6 weeks as outlined above though final duration TBD in ID clinic  - Please ensure OP ID referral placed prior to discharge     In order to facilitate outpatient discharge planning:     - Disposition: SNF/Rehab     - Indication for treatment:  Bone and joint infection and Soft tissue infection     - Antimicrobial(s), Dose, Route, Frequency: IV cefepime 2g Q8H     - Start Date: 01/17/2024     - Anticipated Duration of Therapy: At least 6 weeks     - Please order 8 weeks of antimicrobial(s) at the time of discharge. Patient should not stop antibiotics until being seen in ID clinic.      - Weekly Labs: CBC with differential and CMP  Fax lab results to 999-999-9999 (Hoover Infectious Disease Clinic) after discharge     - PICC Care: Please include the following orders in the discharge paperwork:               - Weekly routine PICC Care               - May declog PICC line x1 with alteplase IV \n2 mg/mL. If needed, may repeat x1.     - Follow-up Service:  General ID Clinic (Garden )      - Follow-up Time Period:  Within 1-2 weeks. Inform ID clinic with issue in scheduling      - Follow-up Provider:  General ID Clinic     - Safety Monitoring Before ID Clinic Appointment: Due to limited resources, please note that antimicrobial adverse reactions and labs will need to be monitored by the primary team's Attending Physician at the time of discharge and/or the patient's PCP until the patient has established care with an ID provider in clinic.     - At the time of discharge, please place outpatient referral to Infectious Disease Clinic. After the patient is discharged, our clinic staff will call the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment.      Thank you for this consultation. We will sign off. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any additional questions or if pending intra-operative cultures grow out new organisms/organisms resistant to cefepime.     This patient was seen and staffed with Dr. Gifford, MD, who agrees with the above assessment and plan, except as amended. Recommendations communicated to primary team.     Lasser (Lyla Sweeney, MD  PGY-4 Infectious Diseases     ENT ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS:   Zane Mukherjee is a 39 Y male with history of percutaneous tracheostomy on 11/21. Patient was taken to OR today by Neurosurgery colleagues. General anesthesia was induced via 8-0 cuffless Shiley with subsequent difficulty in ventilation. Now s/p easy trach change to 6-0 cuffed Shiley, with faceplate sutured to skin on account of Neurosurgery needing access to posterior neck. Per NSGY, would like to avoid trach ties for approximately one week post-op.      - Patient now has a 6-0 cuffed Shiley in place, sutured to the skin. Obturator should be above bed at all times   - Trach change was performed without difficulty. This is a mature tracheostoma. In the future, would not \nadvise patient to be induced with cuffless tracheostomy. If for some reason patient has cuffless tracheostomy in place but requires positive pressure ventilation, his tracheostomy can be exchanged by any skilled RT or Anesthesia provider to a cuffed tracheostomy tube using an obturator. While awaiting obtaining a cuffed tracheostomy in such a scenario, occlude the mouth and nose to ventilate via the cuffless tracheostomy until a cuffed device can be obtained.   - Please also note patient is intubatable from above - 11/17 anesthesia note indicates difficult two handed mask; however, he was G1V with video laryngoscope GVL STAT 4. From ENT standpoint, could also consider LMA as a rescue device if unable to recannulate stoma in an emergency.    - Patient has trach sutured in place. DO NOT DISCHARGE PATIENT WITH TRACH SUTURED IN. When ready to allow soft blue collar, sutures will need to be cut and trach should be exchanged to cuffless if he is not requiring PPV   - Tracheostomy was initially placed by Pulmonology and we defer further tracheostomy management to their team. If pulmonology colleagues require our assistance in cutting suture or swapping tracheostomy when the time comes per Neurosurgery, please notify us at pager 27085.         VTE prophylaxis/anti-coagulation: Per primary team, no restrictions from OHNS service  Antibiotics: Per primary team, no indication from OHNS service.  Diet: Per primary team, no restrictions from OHNS service  Planned inpatient follow up: PRN         Patient discussed with the primary team.

Continued on IV antibiotics per ID. Unable to proceed with original CK plan per neurosurgery due to patient's obesity, therefore remained inpatient for 15 fractions of radiation per radiation oncology.     The discharge plan, including (but not limited to) medications, wound care instructions, warning signs, physical activity limitations, and follow-up information were reviewed with the patient and family, who verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan.    Radiation Oncology:  DIAGNOSIS: Illiana Nagi, \"Illiana\", MRN [000000], 40 Y male Foramen magnum meningioma s/p STR 12/04/2023 c/b signif neuro deficits, grade 1 on path but growing solid/cystic component on 1 mo interval scan, readmitted for wound dehiscence and pending inpt IV abx.

XRT hx:  VMAT to residual meningioma 40.05Gy/15fx (01/28/2014-02/17/2024)     IDENTIFICATION and INDICATIONS: Mr. Nagi underwent definitive (non-metastatic) radiotherapy for post op residual meningioma. Mr. Nagi was initially seen for consultation and after he indicated an understanding of the rationale, risks, and potential benefits of radiation therapy, informed consent was obtained and placed in the medical record.     COURSE:  A CT simulation was performed with Mr. Sweeney in the supine position. A customized immobilization device was created to minimize inter-fraction variability in patient positioning. Target volumes were \ndelineated using computerized software and special care was taken to limit the radiation dose to surrounding critical structures. Mr. Nagi was seen weekly on treatment for side effect management and supportive care. The treatment was tolerated without unexpected side effects.      Predating RT and ongoing/status by end of treatment:  -Per pt some new mvmt in L hand fingers (baseline was just R hand finger mvmt); no worsening neuro issues (wkness/numbness/etc)  -Stable intermittent mild headaches w stable neck spasms (worsens when coughs) being managed by inpt  -Since before current admission, continued episodes of blackout/unresponsiveness that happen after strong coughing     -Coughing has decreased in past few weeks but still present given the trach  -Stable intermittent mild nausea     Medical management and supportive care by inpatient team.

Johnson now sutured in.   - SLP consult for PMV    ENT Recommendations 12/30:  - Patient now has a 6-0 cuffed Shiley in place, sutured to the skin. Obturator should be above bed at all times   - Trach change was performed without difficulty. This is a mature tracheostoma. In the future, would not advise patient to be induced with cuffless tracheostomy. If for some reason patient has cuffless tracheostomy in place but requires positive pressure ventilation, his tracheostomy can be exchanged by any skilled RT or Anesthesia provider to a cuffed tracheostomy tube using an obturator. While awaiting obtaining a cuffed tracheostomy in such a scenario, occlude the mouth and nose to ventilate via the cuffless tracheostomy until a cuffed device can be obtained.   - Please \nalso note patient is intubatable from above - 11/17 anesthesia note indicates difficult two handed mask; however, he was G1V with video laryngoscope GVL STAT 4. From ENT standpoint, could also consider LMA as a rescue device if unable to recannulate stoma in an emergency.    - Patient has trach sutured in place. DO NOT DISCHARGE PATIENT WITH TRACH SUTURED IN. When ready to allow soft blue collar, sutures will need to be cut and trach should be exchanged to cuffless if he is not requiring PPV   - Tracheostomy was initially placed by Pulmonology and we defer further tracheostomy management to their team.

Glass, MD, MBA  Surgical Co-management Hospitalist    Infectious Disease Assessment & Plan:  Illiana Nagi is a 39 YO M with a PMHx notable for HTN and relatively recently discovered 2cm foramen magnum mass s/p resection (12/04/2023 with pathology + for meningioma) c/b wound dehiscence now s/p wound revision/I&D. ID consulted for antimicrobial recommendations.     #Foramen magnum mass s/p subtotal resection c/b SAH + wound dehiscence c/f underlying infection   Interval history notable for recent admission for subtotal resection of foramen magnum mass c/b SAH into intraventricular space, loss of Sentinel Butte /LE motor function, and double vision. Patient additionally had PEG tube and trach placed following surgery. Post-operative course now complicated by incision site breakdown concerning for possible underlying wound infection.      Patient went to OR on 12/31 with notation of superficial infection, though on further discussion with NSGY team, they did note that infected area did directly contact skull bones. After discussion with NSGY team, decision made to treat patient for prolonged duration given above findings (contact with bone) + M&M of undertreating infection close to CNS. Reassuringly, no clinical evidence of meningitis on exam.     Intra-operative cultures with growth of MSSA \n+ Klebsiella aerogenes (with a low MIC to cefepime). Klebsiella aerogenes can harbor a chromosomal ampC (inducible beta-lactamase) with preferred agents for treatment including cefepime (poor inducer and substrate for ampC) or carbapenems. With RE: to oral therapy, we note that with patient's weight/size, he would require extremely high doses of bactrim for treatment, so would recommend avoiding and continuing treatment with cefepime on discharge. We also note that separate wound culture from 12/31 demonstrated growth but was too young to identify and is being reincubated. We expect this to grow out previously isolated MSSA or Klebsiella, but please do not hesitate to reach back out if culture grows out new organism not covered by cefepime.     Current renal function:  Estimated Creatinine Clearance: 290.1 mL/min (A) (by C-G formula based on SCr of 0.56 mg/dL (L)).       RECOMMENDATIONS:  - Follow up 12/31 intra-operative cultures to finality  - Recommend continuing IV cefepime 2g Q8H               - Anticipate treatment for at least 6 weeks as outlined above though final duration TBD in ID clinic  - Please ensure OP ID referral placed prior to discharge     In order to facilitate outpatient discharge planning:     - Disposition: SNF/Rehab     - Indication for treatment:  Bone and joint infection and Soft tissue infection     - Antimicrobial(s), Dose, Route, Frequency: IV cefepime 2g Q8H     - Start Date: 01/17/2024     - Anticipated Duration of Therapy: At least 6 weeks     - Please order 8 weeks of antimicrobial(s) at the time of discharge. Patient should not stop antibiotics until being seen in ID clinic.      - Weekly Labs: CBC with differential and CMP  Fax lab results to 999-999-9999 (Hoover Infectious Disease Clinic) after discharge     - PICC Care: Please include the following orders in the discharge paperwork:               - Weekly routine PICC Care               - May declog PICC line x1 with alteplase IV \n2 mg/mL. If needed, may repeat x1.     - Follow-up Service:  General ID Clinic (Garden )      - Follow-up Time Period:  Within 1-2 weeks. Inform ID clinic with issue in scheduling      - Follow-up Provider:  General ID Clinic     - Safety Monitoring Before ID Clinic Appointment: Due to limited resources, please note that antimicrobial adverse reactions and labs will need to be monitored by the primary team's Attending Physician at the time of discharge and/or the patient's PCP until the patient has established care with an ID provider in clinic.     - At the time of discharge, please place outpatient referral to Infectious Disease Clinic. After the patient is discharged, our clinic staff will call the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment.      Thank you for this consultation. We will sign off. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any additional questions or if pending intra-operative cultures grow out new organisms/organisms resistant to cefepime.     This patient was seen and staffed with Dr. Gifford, MD, who agrees with the above assessment and plan, except as amended. Recommendations communicated to primary team.     Lasser (Lyla Sweeney, MD  PGY-4 Infectious Diseases     ENT ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS:   Zane Mukherjee is a 39 Y male with history of percutaneous tracheostomy on 11/21. Patient was taken to OR today by Neurosurgery colleagues. General anesthesia was induced via 8-0 cuffless Shiley with subsequent difficulty in ventilation. Now s/p easy trach change to 6-0 cuffed Shiley, with faceplate sutured to skin on account of Neurosurgery needing access to posterior neck. Per NSGY, would like to avoid trach ties for approximately one week post-op.      - Patient now has a 6-0 cuffed Shiley in place, sutured to the skin. Obturator should be above bed at all times   - Trach change was performed without difficulty. This is a mature tracheostoma. In the future, would not \nadvise patient to be induced with cuffless tracheostomy. If for some reason patient has cuffless tracheostomy in place but requires positive pressure ventilation, his tracheostomy can be exchanged by any skilled RT or Anesthesia provider to a cuffed tracheostomy tube using an obturator. While awaiting obtaining a cuffed tracheostomy in such a scenario, occlude the mouth and nose to ventilate via the cuffless tracheostomy until a cuffed device can be obtained.   - Please also note patient is intubatable from above - 11/17 anesthesia note indicates difficult two handed mask; however, he was G1V with video laryngoscope GVL STAT 4. From ENT standpoint, could also consider LMA as a rescue device if unable to recannulate stoma in an emergency.    - Patient has trach sutured in place. DO NOT DISCHARGE PATIENT WITH TRACH SUTURED IN.

Continued on IV antibiotics per ID. Unable to proceed with original CK plan per neurosurgery due to patient's obesity, therefore remained inpatient for 15 fractions of radiation per radiation oncology.     The discharge plan, including (but not limited to) medications, wound care instructions, warning signs, physical activity limitations, and follow-up information were reviewed with the patient and family, who verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan.    Radiation Oncology:  DIAGNOSIS: Illiana Nagi, \"Illiana\", MRN [000000], 40 Y male Foramen magnum meningioma s/p STR 12/04/2023 c/b signif neuro deficits, grade 1 on path but growing solid/cystic component on 1 mo interval scan, readmitted for wound dehiscence and pending inpt IV abx. S/p VMAT to residual meningioma.     XRT hx:  VMAT to residual meningioma 40.05Gy/15fx (01/28/2014-02/17/2024)     IDENTIFICATION and INDICATIONS: Mr. Nagi underwent definitive (non-metastatic) radiotherapy for post op residual meningioma. Mr. Nagi was initially seen for consultation and after he indicated an understanding of the rationale, risks, and potential benefits of radiation therapy, informed consent was obtained and placed in the medical record.     COURSE:  A CT simulation was performed with Mr. Sweeney in the supine position. A customized immobilization device was created to minimize inter-fraction variability in patient positioning. Target volumes were \ndelineated using computerized software and special care was taken to limit the radiation dose to surrounding critical structures. Mr. Nagi was seen weekly on treatment for side effect management and supportive care. The treatment was tolerated without unexpected side effects.      Predating RT and ongoing/status by end of treatment:  -Per pt some new mvmt in L hand fingers (baseline was just R hand finger mvmt); no worsening neuro issues (wkness/numbness/etc)  -Stable intermittent mild headaches w stable neck spasms (worsens when coughs) being managed by inpt  -Since before current admission, continued episodes of blackout/unresponsiveness that happen after strong coughing     -Coughing has decreased in past few weeks but still present given the trach  -Stable intermittent mild nausea     Medical management and supportive care by inpatient team.

Johnson now sutured in.   - SLP consult for PMV    ENT Recommendations 12/30:  - Patient now has a 6-0 cuffed Shiley in place, sutured to the skin. Obturator should be above bed at all times   - Trach change was performed without difficulty. This is a mature tracheostoma. In the future, would not advise patient to be induced with cuffless tracheostomy. If for some reason patient has cuffless tracheostomy in place but requires positive pressure ventilation, his tracheostomy can be exchanged by any skilled RT or Anesthesia provider to a cuffed tracheostomy tube using an obturator. While awaiting obtaining a cuffed tracheostomy in such a scenario, occlude the mouth and nose to ventilate via the cuffless tracheostomy until a cuffed device can be obtained.   - Please \nalso note patient is intubatable from above - 11/17 anesthesia note indicates difficult two handed mask; however, he was G1V with video laryngoscope GVL STAT 4. From ENT standpoint, could also consider LMA as a rescue device if unable to recannulate stoma in an emergency.    - Patient has trach sutured in place. DO NOT DISCHARGE PATIENT WITH TRACH SUTURED IN. When ready to allow soft blue collar, sutures will need to be cut and trach should be exchanged to cuffless if he is not requiring PPV   - Tracheostomy was initially placed by Pulmonology and we defer further tracheostomy management to their team. If pulmonology colleagues require our assistance in cutting suture or swapping tracheostomy when the time comes per Neurosurgery, please notify us at pager 27085.      #s/p PEG tube placement  - Recommend SLP c/s (patient was making progress per report at SNF)  - Recommend Nutrition c/s for TF  - Continuous TF at present     #Gout  No active flares at this time per patient but commonly gets in L foot     # Delirium prevention  - Baseline cognitive status:  A&Ox4  - Risk factors for delirium: N/A  - Use delirium order set (\"IP Gen Delirium\")  - Use delirium accordion/summary report on EPIC to identify current deliriogenic meds -- Minimize use as able  - Limit opiates/benzos/anticholinergics as able.

Glass, MD, MBA  Surgical Co-management Hospitalist    Infectious Disease Assessment & Plan:  Illiana Nagi is a 39 YO M with a PMHx notable for HTN and relatively recently discovered 2cm foramen magnum mass s/p resection (12/04/2023 with pathology + for meningioma) c/b wound dehiscence now s/p wound revision/I&D. ID consulted for antimicrobial recommendations.     #Foramen magnum mass s/p subtotal resection c/b SAH + wound dehiscence c/f underlying infection   Interval history notable for recent admission for subtotal resection of foramen magnum mass c/b SAH into intraventricular space, loss of Sentinel Butte /LE motor function, and double vision. Patient additionally had PEG tube and trach placed following surgery. Post-operative course now complicated by incision site breakdown concerning for possible underlying wound infection.      Patient went to OR on 12/31 with notation of superficial infection, though on further discussion with NSGY team, they did note that infected area did directly contact skull bones. After discussion with NSGY team, decision made to treat patient for prolonged duration given above findings (contact with bone) + M&M of undertreating infection close to CNS. Reassuringly, no clinical evidence of meningitis on exam.     Intra-operative cultures with growth of MSSA \n+ Klebsiella aerogenes (with a low MIC to cefepime). Klebsiella aerogenes can harbor a chromosomal ampC (inducible beta-lactamase) with preferred agents for treatment including cefepime (poor inducer and substrate for ampC) or carbapenems. With RE: to oral therapy, we note that with patient's weight/size, he would require extremely high doses of bactrim for treatment, so would recommend avoiding and continuing treatment with cefepime on discharge. We also note that separate wound culture from 12/31 demonstrated growth but was too young to identify and is being reincubated. We expect this to grow out previously isolated MSSA or Klebsiella, but please do not hesitate to reach back out if culture grows out new organism not covered by cefepime.     Current renal function:  Estimated Creatinine Clearance: 290.1 mL/min (A) (by C-G formula based on SCr of 0.56 mg/dL (L)).       RECOMMENDATIONS:  - Follow up 12/31 intra-operative cultures to finality  - Recommend continuing IV cefepime 2g Q8H               - Anticipate treatment for at least 6 weeks as outlined above though final duration TBD in ID clinic  - Please ensure OP ID referral placed prior to discharge     In order to facilitate outpatient discharge planning:     - Disposition: SNF/Rehab     - Indication for treatment:  Bone and joint infection and Soft tissue infection     - Antimicrobial(s), Dose, Route, Frequency: IV cefepime 2g Q8H     - Start Date: 01/17/2024     - Anticipated Duration of Therapy: At least 6 weeks     - Please order 8 weeks of antimicrobial(s) at the time of discharge. Patient should not stop antibiotics until being seen in ID clinic.      - Weekly Labs: CBC with differential and CMP  Fax lab results to 999-999-9999 (Hoover Infectious Disease Clinic) after discharge     - PICC Care: Please include the following orders in the discharge paperwork:               - Weekly routine PICC Care               - May declog PICC line x1 with alteplase IV \n2 mg/mL. If needed, may repeat x1.     - Follow-up Service:  General ID Clinic (Garden )      - Follow-up Time Period:  Within 1-2 weeks. Inform ID clinic with issue in scheduling      - Follow-up Provider:  General ID Clinic     - Safety Monitoring Before ID Clinic Appointment: Due to limited resources, please note that antimicrobial adverse reactions and labs will need to be monitored by the primary team's Attending Physician at the time of discharge and/or the patient's PCP until the patient has established care with an ID provider in clinic.     - At the time of discharge, please place outpatient referral to Infectious Disease Clinic. After the patient is discharged, our clinic staff will call the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment.      Thank you for this consultation. We will sign off. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any additional questions or if pending intra-operative cultures grow out new organisms/organisms resistant to cefepime.     This patient was seen and staffed with Dr. Gifford, MD, who agrees with the above assessment and plan, except as amended. Recommendations communicated to primary team.     Lasser (Lyla Sweeney, MD  PGY-4 Infectious Diseases     ENT ASSESSMENT & RECOMMENDATIONS:   Zane Mukherjee is a 39 Y male with history of percutaneous tracheostomy on 11/21. Patient was taken to OR today by Neurosurgery colleagues. General anesthesia was induced via 8-0 cuffless Shiley with subsequent difficulty in ventilation. Now s/p easy trach change to 6-0 cuffed Shiley, with faceplate sutured to skin on account of Neurosurgery needing access to posterior neck. Per NSGY, would like to avoid trach ties for approximately one week post-op.      - Patient now has a 6-0 cuffed Shiley in place, sutured to the skin. Obturator should be above bed at all times   - Trach change was performed without difficulty. This is a mature tracheostoma. In the future, would not \nadvise patient to be induced with cuffless tracheostomy. If for some reason patient has cuffless tracheostomy in place but requires positive pressure ventilation, his tracheostomy can be exchanged by any skilled RT or Anesthesia provider to a cuffed tracheostomy tube using an obturator. While awaiting obtaining a cuffed tracheostomy in such a scenario, occlude the mouth and nose to ventilate via the cuffless tracheostomy until a cuffed device can be obtained.   - Please also note patient is intubatable from above - 11/17 anesthesia note indicates difficult two handed mask; however, he was G1V with video laryngoscope GVL STAT 4.

Course c/b encephalopathy, dysarthria, leukocytosis and fever, tachycardia, hepatic abscess, anemia and respiratory failure. Transferred from OHS on 12/25 to MICU, then downgraded to medicine floor 12/26 for ongoing HF and infection management. NCC initially consulted on 12/25 c/f seizures, which was attributed to ertapenem. On 1/11, pt transferred from medicine floor to NCC for c/f seizure, requiring intubation. Transferred to neuro floor on 1/18 for workup of acute on chronic asymmetrical weakness. Transferring back to acute care hospital.     Reason for Hospitalization: SOB and edema    Outstanding issues for outside hospital reconciliation:  [ ] Reassess meeting nutritional goal and can discontinue keofeeding tube if meeting > 65% daily caloric needs with PO + ensure boosts  [ ] Can discontinue PICC if no further daily labs required, patient prefers to continue as she finds IV lab draws from peripheral veins to be difficult and painful  [ ] Uptitrate neuropathic pain regimen: lyrica, multimodal creams/patches as needed  [ ] Downtitrate off clobazam in the next 3-4 days, continue keppra+topamax until outpatient   [ ] Repeat BMP for sodium trend one more time at OHS  [ ] PT/OT for rehab needs  [ ] Left calf biopsy wound care, please \nremove staples if not oozing    Summary of Hospital Course:     Prior to admission patient reported 18 months of new painful Raynaud's, associated with fingertip ulcerations, as well as 100 lbs of unintentional weight loss due to nausea/vomiting and progressive bilat feet swelling+numbness.     Presented to OSH 2 weeks prior to transfer w/ SOB. Last SOB, reported having a right upper lobe pneumonia in 02/17/2021. Along with shortness of breath, patient noted to have increasing edema involving bilateral lower extremities and thighs resulting in increasing weakness of lower extremities.  OSH workup was notable for right heart failure secondary to presumed pulmonary hypertension, E. coli UTI, transaminitis, and AKI. Pt was transferred to Stanford MICU on 1/25 and downgraded to floor 12/26 for ongoing infection management.     After being downgraded to floor level of care on 12/26, patient developed a fever of 101 and leukocytosis of 31K.  Antibiotics broadened at that time to ertapenem and vancomycin with ongoing diuresis.  Hospital course was complicated by tachycardia up to 140s and intermittent encephalopathy. On 12/30, she had worsening mentation and was broadened to meningitis coverage. LP was performed and results were unrevealing. On 1/1 AM, patient with worsening mental status and seizure like activity. She was keppra loaded and escalated to the ICU. She was transferred to NCC on 12/16/2023 for status epilepticus.    Patient was transferred to neurology wards service on 12/22/2023 for workup and management of acute on chronic bilat LE weakness and numbness. Differential remained broad from autoimmune, vasculitis, paraneoplastic to toxic-metabolic. She remained stable from a seizure standpoint and cEEG was discontinued on 12/24/2023. She underwent PET CT on 1/16 that was notable for avid LNs in the thorax, neck, and bilateral gastroc/subcutaneous tissue of her distal lower extremities. She underwent biopsy via neuro IR \non 12/27/2023. She also underwent muscle and sural nerve biopsy on 12/28/2023. She underwent further workup with MRI C and T spine to evaluate patient's diffuse weakness, which was unremarkable. Her EMG/NCS revealed severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy in the left leg. Initial muscle and nerve biopsy without evidence of vasculitis however notable for mullerian degeneration around the nerves and fat vacuoles with decreased type 2 muscle fibers, concerning for an acute on chronic picture.     For her acute on chronic bilat sensory polyneuropathy, 5 days of pulse dose steroids were tried to treat presumed rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology, followed by 3 days of IVIG for presumed autoimmune etiology. She tolerated both therapies well with some improvement in strength. At time of discharge, diagnosis still remains broad despite both invasive and noninvasive diagnostic evaluation.       Brief HPI - Per Admission H&P:   As per admission H&P 12/25 to MICU:  \"Patient reports being diagnosed with lupus approximately 1 year ago, prior to this recent hospitalization the last time she reports having trouble breathing was from a RUL PNA around 02/17/2021. She had been of usual state of health until around 2 weeks ago when she started becoming more SOB. She also notes becoming more swollen over that time which was most notable in BLE/BL thighs.   While in OSH work-up was most notable for RH failure 2/2 to presumed pulm htn, e. Coli UTI, transaminitis, sepsis and AKI.   Patient feels her breathing has not improved and her SOB has remained stable. Her swelling however has improved. \"    As per admission H&P 1/1 to MICU:  \"Per initial evaluation by rheumatology, patient endorsed 18 months of new painful Raynaud's, associated with fingertip ulcerations.  Reports unclear history of unintentional weight loss, possibly up to 100 pounds over the past year due to ongoing nausea and vomiting.  Denied oral or nasal ulcers, alopecia, sicca \nsymptoms, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash or photosensitivity, history of blood clots or miscarriages.      HOME MEDS prior to hospitalization:   Armodafinil  Estrogen   Prevacid  Losartan 100   Pork thyroid 75 mcg daily  Oxy + Xytamza  Zofran      Presented to OSH 2 weeks prior to transfer w/ SOB. Last SOB, reported having a right upper lobe pneumonia in 02/17/2021. Along with shortness of breath, patient noted to have increasing edema involving bilateral lower extremities and thighs resulting in increasing weakness of lower extremities.  OSH workup was notable for right heart failure secondary to presumed pulmonary hypertension, E. coli UTI, transaminitis, and AKI. Pt was transferred to Stanford and downgraded to floor 10/26.     After being downgraded to floor on 12/26, patient developed fever to 101. WBC elevated to 31K.  Antibiotics broadened at that time to ertapenem and vancomycin with ongoing diuresis.  Hospital course is also been complicated by tachycardia up to 140s. Patient is also experienced confusion and altered mentation; at baseline, patient is alert and oriented x 4 and very sharp. Pt with worsening mentation and query neck stiff on 12/30 so broadened to meningitis coverage. LP was performed and unrevealing. On 1/1 AM pt with worsening mental status and seizure like activity. Pt was keppra loaded and escalated to the ICU.\"    Additional history from patient and her husband Elbert on 01/02/2024 at bedside:  -11/29/2022 patient noticed that she had lost weight because she wasn't fitting into her regular clothes at Christmas time.   -May-05/20/2023 patient started to feel some numbness in her legs and feet up to her shins. She would notice it getting out of bed, her calves were swelling more. She walks barefoot often and had no trouble with cuts or damage to her feet. There was no change in her ability to function or work as a CT technologist.  -~Sept-09/19/2023 Progressively losing weight. Still \nwith swelling in feet. Worsening nausea and vomiting. Her mood was very low, as her mother was dying at this time.  -Thanksgiving 2023 Patient barely able to eat and keep food down due to nausea and vomiting. She was taking an old Rx of Reglan and felt that it was \"creating a reaction\", and she would eat something and then vomit it soon afterwards.   -11/05/2023 No abd pain, no diarrhea. Was developing progressively worsening shortness of breath.   -Mid-December she was applying for disability because of progressive SOB.  -11/22/2023- husband noted a few spots of red on her chest, where they currently are now.   -11/23/2023 - last day of work as a CT tech. She was extremely short of breath and her \"feet were swollen and purple, like they were about to pop\". There was no abd pain, no change in urine.  -11/24/2023 - this is the worst day, she had extreme difficulty SOB and she went to Koloa  hospital.  -At no point did she have weakness, worsening numbness, nor significant abd pain.    Hospital Course and Discharge Plan, by Issue:     Active Issues:  #Bilateral limb weakness, asymmetric and proximal>distal  #Painful bilat LE  #Bilat LE ascending axonal polyneuropathy  Stroke code 1/13 for new L-sided weakness, imaging unrevealing. Noted anti-gravity (4 or greater bilateral deltoids) on 1/5 and 1/12 NCC consult. Cannot lift anti-gravity 1/19 onwards, then L arm returned to anti-gravity on 1/23 or so, correlated with normalization of R parietal diffusion restriction suggesting the weaknes was post-ictal Swagler's paralysis. Exam shows L worse than R, distal worse than proximal weakness with very severe L weakness, bilateral paresthesias, absent reflexes in lowers -- overall localization to peripheral nerves or plexus, supported on EMG/NCS as peripheral weakness localizing to nerves.    Previously positive ANA (1:320, 1:80 nuclear homogenous), though repeat during this hospitalization negative. \nExtensive serologies, including ANA, Smith ab, RNP Ab, SSA ab, SSB ab, SCL70 ab, anti-centromere ab, RNA Polymerase III ab, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, PR3, MPO, and cryoprotein were negative. Otherwise, noted to have mildly elevated RF and mildly decreased C4. Started on high-dose Solumedrol at Raphine  given c/f worsening systemic rheumatologic disorder, but dc'd 12/26. Restarted IV solumedrol 1/25 - 01/03/2024.    For context (per chart review), over the past year, patient has experienced significant hair loss, fatigue, joint pain, recurrent oral ulcers, and approximately 100 lb weight loss.

Brain parenchyma with normalized diffusion restriction. No signs of vasculitlis.      PET/CT Tumor Localization Whole Body (12/21/2023)   1.  Intense abnormal uptake is present within the brain, particularly within the right cingulate gyrus as well as corresponding to previously some other previously identified MRI signal abnormalities. Areas of hypometabolism are not seen.   2.  Hypermetabolic lymph nodes are also noted present largely above the diaphragm. Most prominently in the neck, especially in the right IIa region.   3.  Intense increased uptake is present within the subcutaneous fat of the lower extremities, particularly below the knees without significant degree of anatomic correlate. The uptake is out of proportion to anatomic findings.  4.  Irregular foci of uptake within the subcutaneous fat are noted in a scattered distribution involving the lower extremities (particularly below the knees), buttocks and the upper extremities just above the elbows.      MR Brain w and wo Contrast (12/19/2023)   1.  Increased territory of cortical diffusion restriction/high DWI signal now involving the right cingulate gyrus and right more than left parietal lobes with elevated ASL signal. Several affected areas in the right cerebral hemisphere also demonstrated increased T2/FLAIR signal. Findings suggestive of ongoing seizure activity.  2.  Symmetric size and signal intensity of the hippocampal formations.     MR Brain w and wo Contrast (12/16/2023)   1.  Subtle cortical diffusion restriction, mild T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, and ASL hyperperfusion along the right precentral gyrus and extending mildly along the posterior aspect of the right superior frontal gyrus, new compared to 12/05/2023. These findings can be seen in the setting of ongoing seizure activity.   2.  Visually symmetric hippocampi, which appear normal in size and \nsignal.     CT Head Neck Venography w IV Contrast (12/16/2023)   1.  No acute hemorrhage, large territory infarction or mass effect.   2.  No flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm in the intracranial and extracranial circulations. No thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses.   3.  No dissection in the visualized neck vessels and aorta.     MR Skull Base Neck w and wo IV Contrast (12/05/2023)   1.  Nonspecific edema of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, strap muscles, and left scalene musculature. No drainable fluid collection.     MR Brain w and wo Contrast (12/05/2023)   1.  When compared to 12/01/2023, there is nonspecific incomplete suppression of CSF on FLAIR sequence, likely to be related to hyperoxygenation. Infection is considered less likely given recent CSF studies without elevated cells or protein.   2.  No acute infarct.   3.  Similar to MR of 12/01/2023 is nonspecific diffuse dural enhancement over both convexities, which could be related to pachymeningeal information or reactive dural thickening from other etiologies including recent spinal intervention. No abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement.    4.  Previously noted focus of enhancement in the inferior left basal ganglia is favored to represent normal vessel.   5.  No flow-limiting stenosis.      MR Brain w and wo Contrast (12/01/2023)   1.  6 mm curvilinear focus of enhancement in the inferior left basal ganglia, which may represent a normal vessel, or subacute infarct. Given the provided clinical history, early developing infectious/inflammatory process is an additional consideration but less likely. Recommend attention on follow-up.    2.  Nonspecific uniform dural enhancement over both convexities. With the clinical history, pachymeningeal inflammation could be considered, but no definite involvement of the leptomeninges is documented within the limits of MRI. Low CSF pressure from CSF leak can cause a similar \nappearance, this is felt less likely given the partially empty sella and visible CSF space in the optic nerve sheaths. Other causes of reactive dural thickening cannot be excluded, including recent spinal instrumentation. Follow-up MRI may be helpful to document stability or resolution.     CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis w IV Contrast (12/16/2023)   1.  Interval resolution of the previously seen segment 8/5 hepatic abscess, with mild residual edema.   2.  New mild dilation of the left intrahepatic ducts and increased common bile duct dilation.  3.  No evidence of vasculitis, as queried.      CT Abdomen Pelvis Angiography w and wo IV Contrast (12/05/2023 00:37)   1.  No retroperitoneal hematoma.   2.  Hepatic steatosis.    3.  Similar 1.4 cm hepatic abscess. Additional adjacent areas of focal hepatic hyperenhancement without MR correlate may represent perfusional change or possibly early small inflammation/infection. Attention on follow-up.    4.  Apparent hyperenhancement of biliary epithelium and gallbladder wall may reflect cholangitis or be pseudo-enhancement given significant adjacent steatosis.       MR ABDOMEN CHOLANGIOGRAM WO IV CONTRAST (12/01/2023)   1. Segment 8/5 hepatic abscess measuring up to 1.6 cm.   2. Mild extrahepatic and central intrahepatic ductal dilatation extending intrahepatically to the left lateral segment. No choledocholithiasis, cholangitis or mass.   3. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.   4. Hepatic steatosis with fat fraction of 42%.      CT Abdomen Pelvis w IV Contrast (11/30/2023)   1.  Dilated common bile duct measuring up to 13 mm. Mildly distended gallbladder with trace pericholecystic fluid, nonspecific. Consider further evaluation with ultrasound or MRCP. Hepatomegaly and steatosis.   2.  Prominent diffuse anasarca.   3.  Moderate to large hiatal hernia.   4.  Please see concurrently performed and separately dictated report for description of findings in the chest.   \n  CT Chest Angiography w IV Contrast Pulmonary Embolism (11/30/2023)   1.  No pulmonary embolism.  2.  Pulmonary edema with trace pleural effusions.  3.  Left ventricular hypertrophy.    Other diagnostics:  1/23 EMG/NCS  Impression:  This was an abnormal study. There was electrodiagnostic evidence of a severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy in the left leg.   Further localization is limited based on limited EMG in clinically weak muscles with inability to assess motor unit potentials.   Given mild slowing in left median sensory response, a concurrent left median neuropathy at the wrist, i.e. carpal tunnel syndrome, is possible.   Clinical comment: Given clinical concern for possible peripheral nerve vasculitis, agree with further workup including muscle and nerve biopsy of left sural nerve and left gastrocnemius muscle.       ECHO - Limited TTE (12/14/2023)   1. Normal LV size and systolic function. Estimated LVEF is 60% by MOD. Basal inferior wall hypokinesis. Normal RV size and function.   2. Mild TR.

Impression:  This is an abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing.  There were multiple episodes of clinical myoclonus. There were frequent multifocal jerks, on scalp EEG with 6-8 hz EMG and movement artifacts, waxing and waning, lasting 1 second to 30 minutes, during both sleep and wakefulness. No obvious epileptiform correlate on scalp EEG.  Note made of tachycardia.     LTM from 1/11-1/13  Impression  This EEG was abnormal due to moderate diffuse slowing.   There were multiple episodes of clinical myoclonus which showed corresponding muscle artifact on EEG without clear epileptiform pattern.   There are no seizures or epileptiform discharges. There is significant muscle artifact during episodes.   Comments:   Although clinical myoclonus was seen on video, there was no scalp EEG correlate. Muscle artifact obscures significant portions of the EEG.   Diffuse slowing indicates encephalopathy but is not specific to the cause.

CTA was notable for possible celiac occlusion. She was transferred to Stanford Hospital for emergent surgery and higher level of care on 11/10/2023.     Operative Findings:  Please see detailed operative report.     Brief Hospital Course:   Lauro Zeballos was taken to the OR on 11/10/2023 and underwent the stated procedure above by Dr. Orr. Intra-operatively, the patient received the following blood products: pRBC x 10 units, FFP x6 units, PLT x2 units, cryo x2 units. Post cardiopulmonary bypass TEE revealed mild-to-moderate RV dysfunction and mild LV dysfunction. Intra-operative course was complicated by type B malperfusion with right leg ischemia and compartment syndrome necessitating emergent 4 compartment fasciotomy and TEVAR by Dr. Mclain, Vascular Surgery. She was transferred to CVICU post-operatively for recovery on epinephrine, vasopressin, nitroglycerin, and clevidipine.     Ms. Zeballos had a prolonged stay in the ICU that was complicated by GIB, respiratory failure s/p tracheotomy, and oliguric AKI requiring hemodialysis. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was felt to be stable for transfer to the Intermediate Care Unit for further recovery on 12/29/2023. While on the floor, the patient continued to work with Physical/Occupational Therapy for improved physical mobility. The patient's chest tubes, epicardial pacing wires, and lines were removed without complications.     Patient's admission was further complicated by mediastinitis, persistent leukocytosis, anxiety interfering with HD sessions, and post-operative ileus. On 01/09/2024, patient developed generalized hives thought to be secondary to vancomycin vs IV contrast which was evaluated by Dermatology and \nimproved by the following day.

He was recently admitted for abdominal pain and recurrent ascites. Several CTs have shown narrowing of the central aspect of the SMV and distal splenic vein. Patient presents for paracentesis and possible venoplasty and stenting of the central SMV stenosis. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Attending: Rice, Kirt Jeong, MD Tarantino, Gentry Vidal, MD directly participated in the entirety of the procedure. Fellow - Brooklyn Meier, Kameron Zablocki, MD Primary - Hogenson, Eugene Agnew, MD IMAGING GUIDANCE Pre-procedure imaging: Ultrasound Pre-procedure images saved and sent to PACS: Yes Intra-procedure imaging: Ultrasound, Fluoroscopy Intraprocedure images saved and sent to PACS: Yes Radiation Dose: Air Kerma (mGy): 250 Fluoroscopy time (minutes): 8.4  Anesthesia/Sedation: Level of anesthesia/sedation: General anesthesia Anesthesia/sedation administered by: Anesthesiology  Medications: Local anesthetic: Lidocaine 1% Antibiotics: Cefazolin Contrast: Isovue  47 mL Other Medications per anesthesia team Informed consent obtained from: Patient Interpreter: No Prior to the start of the procedure, all Universal Protocol steps, including a pre-procedure verification process, verification of the procedure site, and a time-out were performed with all relevant personnel in the room. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were used, including hand hygiene and cutaneous antisepsis. TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: PARACENTESIS Patient position: Supine Access side: Right Access site: Abdomen RLQ Access imaging guidance: Ultrasound. Images were saved and stored in PACS Access needle: 5 French Natalia Driscoll exchanged: No Fluid volume (mL): 5750 Fluid description: Yellow Pus: No Fluid clarity: Transparent Technique & Findings: The patient was positioned supine on the fluoroscopy table and general anesthesia was administered.  Preprocedure ultrasound \nwas performed, which showed moderate to large volume ascites.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine. Under ultrasound guidance, a 5 Fr Gold needle was advanced into the ascites. An Amplatz wire was then advanced into the ascites and a 5 Fr pigtail catheter was placed.  After obtaining portal venous access (see below), drainage was very slow through the pigtail catheter, so it was exchanged for a 6 French MPD. A total of 5750 cc of yellow ascites was drained throughout the case. The pigtail catheter was removed at the termination of the procedure. The access site was closed with Dermabond and Steristrips. ACCESS GAINED Access location: Percutaneous trans-hepatic Access site: Right portal Access site modifier: Lateral Ultrasound evaluation of access site performed: Yes. The vessel was sonographically evaluated.  It was judged patent and appropriate for access. Real time ultrasound was used to visualize needle entry into the vessel and a permanent image recorded and stored in PACS System. Concurrent real-time ultrasound visualization of needle entry: Yes Access sheath size (French): 7  Access sheath type: Straight BriteTip Access sheath length (cm): 23 *Ultrasound appearance of access vein: Widely patent Access wire: Nitrex and Amplatz Access catheter used: Greb Technique & Findings: Preprocedure ultrasound was performed and an appropriate peripheral segment 6 portal venous branch was chosen for access.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.  Under ultrasound guidance, a 22 G InRad needle was advanced into the segment 6 peripheral branch.  Appropriate positioning was confirmed with contrast injection and blood return.  A Nitrex wire was advanced through the needle and easily into the SMV.  This was upsized to an Amplatz wire using a Thurman set.  A 7 Fr x 23 cm sheath was then advanced with the tip in the main portal vein. VENOGRAM Catheter tip position:  Superior mesenteric vein Catheters \nused: 5 Fr Marking OmniFlush Contrast used: Isovue Hand injection: Yes Technique & Findings: An Omni Flush catheter was placed through the sheath and into the SMV.  Digital subtraction venograms performed via the flush catheter in the SMV in AP and RAO 30 degrees projections showed no stenosis or filling defect to suggest thrombus in the SMV. Also no stenosis or filling defect in the main portal vein or intrahepatic portal branches. There was no filling of collateral draining veins. PRESSURES (mmHg) SMV: 17 Main Portal: 15 Gradient = 2 Technique & Findings: Superior mesenteric vein pressure was 17 mmHg, with a main portal venous pressure measurement of 15 mmHg. This resulted in a physiologic gradient of 2 mmHg. VENOGRAM Catheter tip position:  Splenic vein Catheters used: Ta set catheter Contrast used: Isovue Hand injection: Yes Technique & Findings: The splenic vein was selected  using a Glidewire advantage wire and Quinlan catheter. During this process, a small torturous varix draining into the portal vein was incidentally selected.  Digital subtraction venogram from the splenic vein showed mild narrowing of the distal splenic vein and no filing defect. PRESSURES (mmHg) Splenic: 16 Main portal: 15 Gradient = 1 Technique & Findings: Splenic vein pressure was 16 mmHg, with a main portal venous pressure measurement of 15 mmHg.  This resulted in a physiologic gradient of 1 mmHg. The findings of portal venography and pressure measurements were discussed with the referring provider, Dr. Astle. Given the absence of hemodynamically significant narrowing, the decision was made to not proceed with further intervention. No stent placement or venoplasty was performed. ACCESS CLOSURE The sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved with Gelfoam torpedoes. The access site was closed with Dermabond and Steristrips. Technique & Findings:  The existing sheath was exchanged for a 7 Fr x 11 cm sheath. The sheath was retracted \nuntil the tip was positioned just at the portal vein branch access site. Embolization of the parenchymal access tract was performed using 3 Gelfoam torpedoes deployed via the sheath under a combination of ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. Complications: None IMPRESSION: 1. Superior mesenteric venogram performed via transhepatic access via a segment 6 portal vein branch showed no stenosis or thrombus in the SMV or main portal vein. No hemodynamically significant gradient between the SMV and main portal vein (2 mmHg). No stent placement or venoplasty was performed. 2. Splenic venogram showed mild narrowing of the distal splenic vein. No hemodynamically significant gradient between the splenic vein and main portal vein (1 mmHg). 3. Imaging guided paracentesis via the right abdomen with drainage of 5L of clear yellow ascites. 4. Embolization of the transhepatic portal vein access site using Gelfoam torpedoes. PLAN: - Transfer back to inpatient ward after brief recovery in PACU In the future, an interpreter will not be required. For future examinations, general anesthesia may be required depending on the type of procedure. We required general anesthesia for this case due to transhepatic access and initial plan for stenting.

He reports nausea, but no emesis. No fever or chills. Abdominal discomfort more from distention, no focal pain.      In ED, afebrile, VSS, labs notable for leukocytosis WBC 15, BUN 12, Cr 0.63, Tbili 0.5, AST 22, ALT 10, Rodin 188, INR 1.7, lipase 12. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed in ED, cytology not consistent w SBP showing abs neutrophils 60. CT A/P showed increased collections within gallbladder wall, narrowing ot the SMV and large volume ascites.    He was admitted to the HPB service for management of his cholecystitis, malnutrition, and ascites.     Hospital \nCourse   Wilma Tomberlin is a 74 Y year old male admitted to Stanford University Medical Center on 11/09/2023 for management of his chronic necrotizing pancreatitis.    The patient's hospital course was notable for:  Malnutrition - Mr. Tomberlin was noted to be quite malnourished with temporal wasting and over 50lb weight loss since 06/15/2023. Patient was motivated to eat however could not take in sufficient calories by mouth. Tube feeds were initiated via keo feeding tube and he was ultimately discharged on osmolite 1.5 at 60cc per hour, continuous. Patient continued to have small volume dark green emesis, likely from functional obstruction from evolving pancreatitis. He can take small sips of clears by mouth, more for comfort but should avoid large volume PO intake at this time.   Cholecystitis - He completed course of 10 day course of zosyn for gallbladder fluid collection with resolution of leukocytosis  Ascties and SMV narrowing - he underwent IR venogram and paracentesis on 12/27. There were no findings of SMV narrowing. 5L ascites were drained. He was also diuresed during his course and will continue lasix 80/aldactone 200mg as an outpatient.    The patient worked with well with PT/OT and nursing staff and he was assessed to benefit from SNF    By day of discharge, the patient was deemed stable and safe for discharge to Skilled nursing facility. Hematology and chemistry lab values were within acceptable limits at the time of discharge. No evidence for hematoma, seroma, or wound infection. The patient was tolerating a Tube feeds, ambulating and voiding independently, with pain controlled on oral medications. The patient was discharged with a bowel regimen and oral pain medications.     The patient was discharged with:  Drains: None. No drains during this admission.   Incision: None  Anticoagulation: Restarted on home DOAC: eliquis (name of medication/dose)  Other pertinent outpatient follow up: Tube Feeds \n(include name and rate/hr): and diuretic management, and outpatient CT scan in 4 weeks            The patient was instructed on wound care and follow up appointments.

Recent Imaging Studies   IR CV IR Body Procedure    Result Date: 11/28/2023  Procedure(s):    IR Portal Venography Intervention; IR Paracentesis; CATH ANGIO/IR GENERAL ANESTHESIA; SECONDARY MODIFIER 11/27/2023 CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old male with cirrhosis of unclear etiology and necrotizing pancreatitis thought to be secondary to gallbladder \nsludge requiring multiple interventions for necrosectomy in the last few months, who has had recurrent ascites. He was recently admitted for abdominal pain and recurrent ascites. Several CTs have shown narrowing of the central aspect of the SMV and distal splenic vein. Patient presents for paracentesis and possible venoplasty and stenting of the central SMV stenosis. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Attending: Rice, Kirt Jeong, MD Tarantino, Gentry Vidal, MD directly participated in the entirety of the procedure. Fellow - Brooklyn Meier, Kameron Zablocki, MD Primary - Hogenson, Eugene Agnew, MD IMAGING GUIDANCE Pre-procedure imaging: Ultrasound Pre-procedure images saved and sent to PACS: Yes Intra-procedure imaging: Ultrasound, Fluoroscopy Intraprocedure images saved and sent to PACS: Yes Radiation Dose: Air Kerma (mGy): 250 Fluoroscopy time (minutes): 8.4  Anesthesia/Sedation: Level of anesthesia/sedation: General anesthesia Anesthesia/sedation administered by: Anesthesiology  Medications: Local anesthetic: Lidocaine 1% Antibiotics: Cefazolin Contrast: Isovue  47 mL Other Medications per anesthesia team Informed consent obtained from: Patient Interpreter: No Prior to the start of the procedure, all Universal Protocol steps, including a pre-procedure verification process, verification of the procedure site, and a time-out were performed with all relevant personnel in the room. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were used, including hand hygiene and cutaneous antisepsis. TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: PARACENTESIS Patient position: Supine Access side: Right Access site: Abdomen RLQ Access imaging guidance: Ultrasound. Images were saved and stored in PACS Access needle: 5 French Natalia Driscoll exchanged: No Fluid volume (mL): 5750 Fluid description: Yellow Pus: No Fluid clarity: Transparent Technique & Findings: The patient was positioned supine on the fluoroscopy table and general anesthesia was administered.  Preprocedure ultrasound \nwas performed, which showed moderate to large volume ascites.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine. Under ultrasound guidance, a 5 Fr Gold needle was advanced into the ascites. An Amplatz wire was then advanced into the ascites and a 5 Fr pigtail catheter was placed.  After obtaining portal venous access (see below), drainage was very slow through the pigtail catheter, so it was exchanged for a 6 French MPD. A total of 5750 cc of yellow ascites was drained throughout the case. The pigtail catheter was removed at the termination of the procedure. The access site was closed with Dermabond and Steristrips. ACCESS GAINED Access location: Percutaneous trans-hepatic Access site: Right portal Access site modifier: Lateral Ultrasound evaluation of access site performed: Yes. The vessel was sonographically evaluated.  It was judged patent and appropriate for access. Real time ultrasound was used to visualize needle entry into the vessel and a permanent image recorded and stored in PACS System. Concurrent real-time ultrasound visualization of needle entry: Yes Access sheath size (French): 7  Access sheath type: Straight BriteTip Access sheath length (cm): 23 *Ultrasound appearance of access vein: Widely patent Access wire: Nitrex and Amplatz Access catheter used: Greb Technique & Findings: Preprocedure ultrasound was performed and an appropriate peripheral segment 6 portal venous branch was chosen for access.  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.  Under ultrasound guidance, a 22 G InRad needle was advanced into the segment 6 peripheral branch.  Appropriate positioning was confirmed with contrast injection and blood return.  A Nitrex wire was advanced through the needle and easily into the SMV.  This was upsized to an Amplatz wire using a Thurman set.  A 7 Fr x 23 cm sheath was then advanced with the tip in the main portal vein. VENOGRAM Catheter tip position:  Superior mesenteric vein Catheters \nused: 5 Fr Marking OmniFlush Contrast used: Isovue Hand injection: Yes Technique & Findings: An Omni Flush catheter was placed through the sheath and into the SMV.  Digital subtraction venograms performed via the flush catheter in the SMV in AP and RAO 30 degrees projections showed no stenosis or filling defect to suggest thrombus in the SMV. Also no stenosis or filling defect in the main portal vein or intrahepatic portal branches. There was no filling of collateral draining veins. PRESSURES (mmHg) SMV: 17 Main Portal: 15 Gradient = 2 Technique & Findings: Superior mesenteric vein pressure was 17 mmHg, with a main portal venous pressure measurement of 15 mmHg. This resulted in a physiologic gradient of 2 mmHg. VENOGRAM Catheter tip position:  Splenic vein Catheters used: Ta set catheter Contrast used: Isovue Hand injection: Yes Technique & Findings: The splenic vein was selected  using a Glidewire advantage wire and Quinlan catheter. During this process, a small torturous varix draining into the portal vein was incidentally selected.  Digital subtraction venogram from the splenic vein showed mild narrowing of the distal splenic vein and no filing defect. PRESSURES (mmHg) Splenic: 16 Main portal: 15 Gradient = 1 Technique & Findings: Splenic vein pressure was 16 mmHg, with a main portal venous pressure measurement of 15 mmHg.  This resulted in a physiologic gradient of 1 mmHg. The findings of portal venography and pressure measurements were discussed with the referring provider, Dr. Astle. Given the absence of hemodynamically significant narrowing, the decision was made to not proceed with further intervention. No stent placement or venoplasty was performed. ACCESS CLOSURE The sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved with Gelfoam torpedoes. The access site was closed with Dermabond and Steristrips. Technique & Findings:  The existing sheath was exchanged for a 7 Fr x 11 cm sheath. The sheath was retracted \nuntil the tip was positioned just at the portal vein branch access site. Embolization of the parenchymal access tract was performed using 3 Gelfoam torpedoes deployed via the sheath under a combination of ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. Complications: None IMPRESSION: 1. Superior mesenteric venogram performed via transhepatic access via a segment 6 portal vein branch showed no stenosis or thrombus in the SMV or main portal vein. No hemodynamically significant gradient between the SMV and main portal vein (2 mmHg). No stent placement or venoplasty was performed. 2. Splenic venogram showed mild narrowing of the distal splenic vein. No hemodynamically significant gradient between the splenic vein and main portal vein (1 mmHg). 3. Imaging guided paracentesis via the right abdomen with drainage of 5L of clear yellow ascites. 4. Embolization of the transhepatic portal vein access site using Gelfoam torpedoes. PLAN: - Transfer back to inpatient ward after brief recovery in PACU In the future, an interpreter will not be required. For future examinations, general anesthesia may be required depending on the type of procedure. We required general anesthesia for this case due to transhepatic access and initial plan for stenting.

Liver and biliary tree: Shrunken and nodular contour. No significant biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is decompressed; prominent gallbladder adenomyomatosis.  \nMultiple apparent gallbladder wall collections largest of which measures 4.4 x 1.4 cm (series 303, image 66), with heterogeneous enhancement of the wall.  The gallbladder wall appears inseparable from the duodenum (series 601 image 100, and colon (series 601 image 82). Spleen: No significant abnormality. Pancreas: Sequela of prior necrotizing pancreatitis with minimal residual normally enhancing tissue in the region of the pancreatic tail. This is similar extensive peripancreatic stranding and multiloculated peripancreatic collections in the retroperitoneum (for example 302/165), with individual collections difficult to measure. Adrenal glands: No significant abnormality. Kidneys and ureters: Scattered hypoattenuating lesions, some of which represent simple cysts while others are subcentimeter and too small to characterize. No hydronephrosis. Gastrointestinal tract: Similar abutment and likely tethering of the hepatic flexure with the peripancreatic collections, with decreased focal reactive wall thickening. The small and large bowel are normal in caliber. Mildly decreased reactive wall thickening in the proximal duodenum, which also abuts the area of inflammation and peripancreatic collections. Colonic diverticulosis. Peritoneal cavity: Large volume ascites, similar to prior. Bladder: No significant abnormality. Pelvic organs: No significant abnormality. Vasculature: Progress narrowing of the proximal SMV, which appears focally occluded. Increased narrowing of the splenic vein which remains patent (302/115). Lymph nodes: Mildly prominent periportal and peripancreatic lymph nodes, similar to prior, likely reactive. Bones and soft tissues: Degenerative change of the spine. Left inguinal hernia, containing fluid.     IMPRESSION: 1.  Since prior CT dated 10/24/",
